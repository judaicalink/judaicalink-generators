The Gidal image Archive
=======================

The Generator take the row from `gidal.csv` and generates a rdf file.

The csv file needs to be edited by hand.
It is based on the beacon file:
http://www.steinheim-institut.de/gba/gidal-bildarchiv-beacon.txt

It only contains entities with a gnd identifier.
